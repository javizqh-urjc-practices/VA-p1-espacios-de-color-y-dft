This project contains code examples created in Visual Studio Code for Computer Vision using C++ & OpenCV & Point Cloud Library (PCL) in ROS2. These examples are created for the Computer Vision Subject of Robotics Software Engineering Degree at URJC.

This package is recommended to use with the [TIAGO](https://github.com/jmguerreroh/tiago_simulator) simulator.

# Run

Execute:
```bash
ros2 launch computer_vision cv.launch.py
```
If you want to use your own robot, in the launcher, change the topic names to match the robot topics.

## FAQs:

* /usr/bin/ld shows libraries conflicts between two versions:

Probably you have installed and built your own OpenCV version, rename your local folder:
```bash
mv /usr/local/lib/cmake/opencv4 /usr/local/lib/cmake/oldopencv4
```
